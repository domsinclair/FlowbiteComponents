# Flowbite Component Library for Pinegrow

This repository contains a Flowbite component Library that can be added to the Pinegrow Library panel. It is for use in Tailwind projects where you would like to make use of Flowbite Components.

Simply download the project to your local machine. Point to the index.html file and for the component selector type in .flowbite

This is very much a work in progress.
